### kettle: Add Container Lifecycle Management and Kubernetes Support

**Repository:** [pointblank-club/kettle](https://github.com/pointblank-club/kettle)

**Full proposal:** [GSOC-2026.md](https://github.com/pointblank-club/kettle/blob/main/GSOC-2026.md)

#### Summary

Extend kettle with full container lifecycle management (create, start, stop, delete) and add Kubernetes integration to run and manage containers as pods.

#### Description

This project focuses on evolving kettle from a minimal runtime engine into a usable container runtime with clear lifecycle primitives and basic Kubernetes compatibility. The work includes wiring lifecycle on top of low-level runtimes, integrating with OCI concepts, and adding a Kubernetes-facing layer to manage containers through standard tooling.

#### Details
